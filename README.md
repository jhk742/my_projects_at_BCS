# my_projects_at_BCS
***MY PROJECTS ONLY

This repository is a collection of all the projects I've worked on during my brief time as a Software Engineer at a food distribution company in Queens, NY.
It is a combination of C# code, of which all were written using the Microsoft Visual Studio (2019) IDE, that establishes a connection with the company's database
to run queries via the use of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

The repository itself will not hold the entirety of the ERP system that was in use during my time at the company. You will find only code that I have written.

Code that may contain sensitive information to the company will be replaced with my name in the follwing manner, "JINKIM".

Unfortunately, as this repository will only contain a handful of the files that comprises the ERP system, the code itself will not compile.
As such, a first-hand experience with the different winforms or an execution of a stored procedure is not possible. I will include as many comments
as I can within the available code to hopefully give you a coherent understanding of what is happening during execution.
